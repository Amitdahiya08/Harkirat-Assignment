Title: Maximum Score String
Tag : Easy-Medium

Description:
Given an array of strings, return the string with the maximum score. 
The score of a string is computed as the sum of the ASCII values of its characters multiplied by their first occurrence index in the string (1-based indexing). 
If two strings have the same score, select the lexicographically smaller string.

Input:

An array of strings arr (1 ≤ |arr| ≤ 100, 1 ≤ |arr[i]| ≤ 100)
where ∣arr[i]∣ is the length of the i-th string.

Output:

A single string, the one with the maximum score (or lexicographically smallest if scores are tied).

Example :

Input:
["abc", "bcd", "a","bac","cdb"]

Output:
bcd

Explanation: string "bcd" and "cdb" has the same ASCII score but "bcd" is lexicographically smaller.
