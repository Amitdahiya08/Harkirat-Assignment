Title: Harkirat's Park Runs
Tag : Medium

Description:
Harkirat runs daily along the circular boundary of a park with a parameter of k.
He diligently notes down each day's running distance in his diary.
After n days of continuous running, Harkirat decides to take a day off to rest.
During this break, he starts analyzing his diary to find pairs of days whose combined running distance forms a complete cycle around the park.
Help Harkirat to find count of those pairs.

Input:

An array of strings arr (1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ |arr[i]| ≤ 10^9) and an integer k (1<=k<=100)
denoting the park length.

Output:
An integer representing the count of unique pairs.

Example :

Input: k = 10,distances = [2, 8, 5, 5, 4, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: Possible pairs forming complete cycles: (2, 8) (cycle of 10 units), (5, 5) (cycle of 10 units), (4, 6) (cycle of 10 units).

Input: k = 12, distances = [3, 6, 9, 4]
Output: 1
